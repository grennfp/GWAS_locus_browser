# Data Processing
* each folder is loosely associated with a section in the browser
* each folder contains data and scripts to run locally or on biowulf
* output of most scripts will go to the `results` folder
* output for most evidence scores will go to the `evidence` folder
* most scripts rely on the `genes_by_locus.csv` and `gwas_risk_variants.csv` files
