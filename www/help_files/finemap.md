# Fine-Mapping of Locus
The [FINEMAP](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/318618v1) tool was used to fine map the Nalls et al., 2019 META5 PD risk loci to identify potential causal variants in LD that are associated with phenotype data. However extensive experimental validation is needed to confirm candidate variants. Variants from summary statistics were partitioned into risk loci based on distance for fine mapping. This method does not take all information into account and the FINEMAP method is limited by assumptions it makes that may not apply to all GWAS loci. Additionally, the summary statistics used as input do not include structural or repeat variants. 

We included variants from the FINEMAP tool with prob > 0.01. Variants were assigned to loci based on distance. Exonic coding variant information was obtained for variants where applicable.
