# Associated Variant Phenotypes

This section lists variants in high linkage disequilibrium with one of the risk snps on this locus that is also associated with some pheontype. P-values are obtained from the [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads). 

## Column Definitions:
* `LD (rsquared)` - r2 linkage disequilibrium value with the risk snp.
* `LD (D')` - d prime linkage disequilibrium value with the risk snp.
* `Frequency (Non-Finnish European)` - frequency of the coding variant in non-Finnish European populations.
* `Other Associated Disease` - the associated disease for the variant obtained from the GWAS Catalog. 
* `P-value` - P-value for the association of the variant with the phenotype. 
* `PMID` - Pubmed ID (PMID) for the relevant study that found the association.
