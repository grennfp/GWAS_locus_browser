# Literature
Genes with significant representation in the literature may be casual. However, this data may be biased or inaccurate. For example, searches for the gene _SHE_, often give papers not relevant to the gene, but instead relevant to the word matching the gene name. Genes with more than five papers on pubmed in the "(GENE_NAME[Title/Abstract]) AND Parkinson's[Title/Abstract]" search were given a score of 1 in the `Literature Search` column in the evidence table. 

## Data
* GeneCards descriptions were obtained from the GeneCards website. 
* wordClouds were generated to show words common to pubmed literature abstracts for each gene.
* Pubmed hit bar plots were included for searches using the term "(GENE_NAME[Title/Abstract]) AND Parkinson's[Title/Abstract]" and the term "GENE_NAME[Title/Abstract]"
