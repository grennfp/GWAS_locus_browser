# Disease Genes
We included a list of genes that are linked to any disease. It is possible some disease genes not previously associated with PD may also modify risk for PD. 

Data was taken from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). For HGMD, only genes with variants classified as "DM" (disease causing mutations) were included. 

Genes present in this table are scored with 1 in the `Disease Gene` column in the evidence table. Genes are scored with 0 if they are not in the disease gene table. 

## Column Definitions:
* `HGMD` - Human Gene Mutation Database associated diseases for the gene
* `OMIM` - Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man associated diseases for the gene, links are included for each disease.
