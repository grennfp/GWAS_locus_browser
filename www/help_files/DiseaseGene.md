# Disease Genes
We included a list of genes involved in diseases besides Parkinson's disease. It is possible some of these genes may also be causal for Parkinson's disease. 

Data was taken from online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) and the human gene mutation database (HGMD). For HGMD, only genes with variants classified as "DM" (disease causing mutations) were included. 

Genes in this table were scored with 1 in the `Disease Gene` column in the evidence table. Genes are scored with 0 if they are not in the disease gene table. 

## Column Definitions
* `HGMD` - Human gene mutation database associated diseases for the gene.
* `OMIM` - Online Mendelian inheritance in man associated diseases for the gene. Links are included for each different disease.
