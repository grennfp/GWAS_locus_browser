# Coding Variants

This section lists coding variants in linkage disequilibrium with one of the risk snps on this locus. Some of the coding variants included have multiple amino acid changes, but we included the most relevant one in the browser. Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores were obtained using ANNOVAR to score the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants. 

## Column Definitions:
* `LD (rsquared)` - r2 linkage disequilibrium value with the risk snp.
* `LD (D')` - d prime linkage disequilibrium value with the risk snp.
* `Frequency (Non-Finnish European)` - frequency of the coding variant in non-Finnish European populations.
* `AA Change` - the relevant amino acid change for this coding variants.
* `CADD (phred)` - the phred scaled combined annoatation dependent depletion score for this coding variant. Explanation [here](https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/info)
