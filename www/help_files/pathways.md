# Gene Network Pathways

Data obtained from the [GeneNetwork](https://www.genenetwork.nl) API in real time. GeneNetwork uses data from 31,499 public RNA-seq samples to determine co-regulated genes and predict pathway membership.  
We have included gene co-regulation data as well as pathway data from both the [Reactome Pathway Database](https://reactome.org/) and [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathway database.  


#### Note: 
Since the data for these tables is obtained in real time, it may take a few seconds to update.
