# Locus Zoom

## Interactive Locus Zoom
Shows GWAS variants and genes 1Mb upstream and 1Mb downstream of the risk variant. The risk variant is uniquely colored purple. Recombination rate peaks are marked in blue and variants are colored by their r2 linkage disequilibrium values. Click "show all genes" to see the full list of genes near this locus. Credit goes to [Statgen github](https://github.com/statgen/locuszoom) for the interactive locuszoom tool.

## Static Locus Zoom
Similar to interactive plot, but a static image generated with tools from [here](http://locuszoom.org/). Shows GWAS variants and genes 1Mb upstream and 1Mb downstream of the risk variant. The risk variant is uniquely colored purple. Recombination rate peaks are marked in blue and variants are colored by their r2 linkage disequilibrium values.
