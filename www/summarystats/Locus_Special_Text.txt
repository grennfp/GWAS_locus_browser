Progression	1	The intergenic variant rs61863020 has been associated with a lower prevalence of insomnia at baseline (OR 0.63 [0.52-0.75]; P-value = 4.74E-8) (Iwaki et al., 2019). It is also a brain eQTL for alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A; P value = 7.2E-4, the Bonferroni corrected P value = 6.5E-3, up-regulation for A allele), a gene reported to be associated with the arousal/sleep state (Gelegen et al., 2014).
Progression	2	The intronic variant rs382940 has been associated with reaching Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 or higher faster (HR 2.04 [1.58-2.62]; P-value = 3.46E-8) and with higher scores in the UPDRS parts 2 and 3 (UPDRS2_scaled: 0.36 [0.15?0.57], P value = 8.21E-04; UPDRS3_scaled: 0.29 [0.14?0.45], P value = 2.18E-04) (Iwaki et al., 2019).
